FLOW OF THE CODE
### **Memory Execution Flow (JavaScript Execution Context & Call Stack)**

Before the code runs, JavaScript creates a **Global Execution Context** (GEC) and a **Call Stack** to manage function calls. The execution happens in two phases:

1.  **Memory Allocation (Creation Phase)**
2.  **Code Execution (Execution Phase)**

* * *

### **Step-by-Step Execution in Memory:**

#### **1\. Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)**

*   JavaScript scans the code and **allocates memory** for variables and functions.

Variable / Function

Memory Allocation

`console.log`

Stored as a built-in function

`setTimeout`

Stored as a built-in function

Arrow function inside `setTimeout`

Allocated in memory

* * *

#### **2\. Execution Phase (Line-by-Line Execution)**

Now, JavaScript executes the code **line by line** using the **Call Stack**.

##### **Step 1:** Execute `console.log("a");`

*   `"a"` is printed to the console.
*   The function call is pushed to the Call Stack â†’ executed â†’ then removed.

##### **Step 2:** Execute `setTimeout(() => { console.log("b"); }, 6000);`

*   `setTimeout` is called.
*   The **callback function** (`() => { console.log("b"); }`) is registered in **Web APIs** with a timer of `6000ms`.
*   `setTimeout` itself **does not block the execution** and is removed from the Call Stack.

##### **Step 3:** Execute `console.log("c");`

*   `"c"` is printed to the console.
*   The function call is pushed to the Call Stack â†’ executed â†’ then removed.

##### **Step 4:** After 6 seconds, the timer completes.

*   The callback function (`console.log("b")`) moves from **Web APIs** to the **Callback Queue**.
*   The **Event Loop** checks if the Call Stack is empty and pushes the function from the Callback Queue to the Call Stack.
*   `console.log("b")` is executed and removed from the stack.

* * *

### **Call Stack Flow**

1.  `console.log("a")` â†’ **Executed & Removed**
2.  `setTimeout()` â†’ **Registers Timer in Web APIs & Removed**
3.  `console.log("c")` â†’ **Executed & Removed**
4.  `After 6s`, Callback (`console.log("b")`) â†’ **Executed & Removed**

* * *

### **Final Execution Order in Memory**

1.  `"a"` is executed first.
2.  `"c"` is executed next.
3.  `"b"` is executed after 6 seconds.

* * *

### **Key Takeaways**

âœ” **Memory Phase:** Functions and variables are allocated in memory before execution.  
âœ” **Execution Phase:** Code runs line by line using the **Call Stack**.  
âœ” **Async Handling:** `setTimeout` registers its callback in **Web APIs**, and it runs only after the main thread is free.
